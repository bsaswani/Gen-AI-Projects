# 🧠 Large Language Model (LLM) Projects

This folder consists of projects built with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, where different models from Hugging Face are explored and tested for practical use cases. Projects include experiments with open-source LLMs such as **LLaMA, Falcon, Mistral**, and others. Some projects apply **LoRA (via PEFT)** for lightweight fine-tuning on small datasets.

# 📌 Projects Included:

1️⃣ **AI Mental Health Companion** – An empathetic chatbot designed to support users with stress, anxiety, and emotional well-being. LoRA was used to efficiently fine-tune LLaMA on a conversational dataset.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used:

**- Python**  
**- Hugging Face Transformers (LLaMA, Falcon, Mistral)**
**-LoRA / PEFT for fine-tuning**
**- Google Colab**  
**- Pandas, NumPy**  

# 📂 **How to Use?**  

**1️⃣ Navigate to a project folder.**  
**2️⃣ Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.**  
**3️⃣ Run all cells to load the LLM, apply LoRA fine-tuning if required, and interact with the model.**
