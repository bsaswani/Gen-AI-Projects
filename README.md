# 🤖 Generative AI Projects

# 🚀 Welcome to my Generative AI Repository  
This repository is dedicated to projects built using **Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt engineering, RAG with vector databases, Agnetic AI, and Reinforcement Learning.** Each project highlights techniques such as context-aware dialogue with LLMs, task orchestration using Agnetic AI, optimized responses through prompt engineering, knowledge retrieval with vector databases, and adaptive learning via reinforcement learning.

# 📌 What's Inside?
**🔹 LLM Projects → Conversational AI, text generation, and intelligent assistants.**

**🔹 Prompt Engineering → Context-aware design, response optimization, and persona-driven interactions.**

**🔹 RAG with Vector Database → Retrieval-Augmented Generation using semantic search, embedding-based document retrieval, and context-grounded LLM responses.**

# 📂 How to Use?
**1️⃣ Navigate to the `LLM, Prompt Engineering and Rag with Vector Database` folder.**  
**2️⃣ Each project contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and a `README.md` with dataset, explanation.**  
**3️⃣ Run the notebook in **Google Colab** to test the project.**
