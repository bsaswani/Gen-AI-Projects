# 🤖 Generative AI Projects

# 🚀 Welcome to my Generative AI Repository!  
This repository is dedicated to projects built using **Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt engineering, RAG with vector databases, Agnetic AI, and reinforcement learning.**  
Each project highlights techniques such as context-aware dialogue with LLMs, task orchestration using Agnetic AI, optimized responses through prompt engineering, knowledge retrieval with vector databases, and adaptive learning via reinforcement learning.
