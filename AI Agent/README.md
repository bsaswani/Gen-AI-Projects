# 🧩 AI Agent Projects

This folder includes projects focused on developing Autonomous and Task-Specific **AI Agents that use Large Language Models (LLMs) with context retrieval, dynamic prompting, and interactive reasoning.** 
These agents simulate human-like understanding and decision-making, using vector databases and structured workflows for intelligent task execution.

# 📌 Projects Included

1️⃣ SmartPrep AI Agent – An intelligent interview preparation agent. It reads a custom multi-role knowledge base and dynamically generates interview questions, 
    answers, and revision topics.

# 🛠 Technologies Used

1. Python

2. LLaMA 3.2 – 1B (Hugging Face Transformers)

3. LangChain

4. FAISS Vector Database

5. Sentence Transformers

6. Google Colab

# 📂 How to Use

1️⃣ Navigate to a project folder.

2️⃣ Open the .ipynb notebook in Google Colab.

3️⃣ Run all cells to load the model, build the FAISS index, and interact with the AI Agent through the console interface.
