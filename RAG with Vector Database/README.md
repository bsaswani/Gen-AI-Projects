# 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation With Vector Database Projects

This folder consists of projects built using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, where external knowledge bases are integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance factual accuracy and contextual understanding. 
Projects use vector databases like FAISS for knowledge retrieval and open-source models such as LLaMA for generation.


# 📌 Projects Included:

**1️⃣ MediQuest Rag with Vector Database – A medical question-answering system that retrieves PubMed abstracts and generates evidence-based answers using LLaMA 3.2 – 1B.**

# 🛠 Technologies Used:
1. Python
2. Hugging Face Transformers (LLaMA)
3. LangChain
4. FAISS Vector Database
5. Google Colab
6. Pandas, NumPy  

# 📂 How to Use?

1️⃣ Navigate to a project folder.  
2️⃣ Open the `.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab**.  
3️⃣ Run all cells to build embeddings, create the FAISS index, and interact with the RAG pipeline.
