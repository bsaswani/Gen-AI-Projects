# 💡 Prompt Engineering Projects

This folder consists of projects built to explore Prompt Engineering techniques with open-source language models from Hugging Face.Each project demonstrates how structured 
prompting (Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot) influences LLM performance in real-world text generation tasks such as resume creation and role-based content generation.

# 📌 Projects Included:
1️⃣ Generative Resume Prompt Engineering – A project that generates professional resumes for various job roles (e.g., Data Scientist, ML Engineer) using Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot prompting with models like Falcon 3B Instruct and Gemma 1B.

# 🛠 Technologies Used:
1. Python
2. Hugging Face Transformers 
3. Prompt Engineering (Zero-Shot, One-Shot, Few-Shot)
4. Google Colab
5. Torch

# 📂 How to Use?
1️⃣ Navigate to a project folder.

2️⃣ Open the .ipynb notebook in Google Colab.

3️⃣ Run all cells to load the model and test prompt-based text generation outputs.
