# 🧩 Generative Resume Prompt Engineering

# 📌 Overview
The Generative Resume Prompt Engineering project demonstrates how Prompt Engineering techniques can guide LLMs to generate structured, professional resumes based on job roles.
Using models such as Falcon 3B Instruct from Hugging Face, this project explores Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot prompting to control output style and accuracy — without any dataset fine-tuning.

# ⚙️ Workflow

1. Define the job role (e.g., Data Scientist).

2. Create Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot prompt templates.

3. Load the Hugging Face model and tokenizer (Falcon 3B).

4. Generate structured resume outputs for each prompt style.

# 📊 Prompt Types

1. Zero-Shot: Generates output with only an instruction prompt.

2. One-Shot: Uses one example to guide structure and tone.

3. Few-Shot: Uses multiple examples to enforce format consistency.

# 🛠 Technologies Used

1. Python
 
2. Hugging Face Transformers (Falcon 3B)
 
3. Prompt Engineering (Zero-Shot, One-Shot, Few-Shot)
 
4. Google Colab

# 🚀 Usage

1. Open Generative_Resume_Prompt_Engineering.ipynb in Google Colab.

2. Enter your Hugging Face token when prompted.

3. Run all cells to generate resumes using different prompt strategies.
