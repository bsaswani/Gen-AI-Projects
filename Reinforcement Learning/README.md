# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Projects

This folder consists of projects built with Reinforcement Learning (RL), where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with environments. Projects include experiments with Q-learning, Policy Gradients, and other RL algorithms applied to OpenAI Gym environments.

# 📌 Projects Included:

1️⃣ FrozenLake Reinforcement Learning Agent – An RL agent designed to solve the FrozenLake-v1 environment using Q-learning. 
The agent learns to reach the goal while avoiding holes by updating a Q-table over multiple episodes.

# 🛠 Technologies Used:
1. Python
   
2. NumPy
   
3. Gymnasium (OpenAI Gym environments)
   
4. Google Colab

# 📂 How to Use?
1️⃣ Navigate to a project folder.

2️⃣ Open the .ipynb notebook in Google Colab.

3️⃣ Run all cells to train the agent and observe step-by-step movements.
